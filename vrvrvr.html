    <img src="images/vrvrvr.jpg" alt="VrVrVr" class="member-photo">
    <p>VrVrVr is the founder and owner of Deadcode Unit. He leads the team and develops some of our most exciting software like this website. He started coding in spring of 2022 making his first prototypes of Gorilla tag fan games, his 1st game was a Gorilla Tag copy named "VrVr Tag", Then "VrVr Taggers", "Monkechimpz", "Chimpanzooo", "Monkeychase V1", "Terormonke V1", "Monkeychase V2", "Terrormonke V2", "Terrormonke V3", "Monke Dash VR", "Quantum Ape" and now, he is taking a break from making games and decided to make software like AI, and websites, and other things. In conclusion, VrVrVr's knowledge and ability to not give up have stayed with him and will hopefully stay with him so he has the confidence and perserverance to lead what was one "WeAreVrVr" to what we know now of "Deadcode Unit"</p>
